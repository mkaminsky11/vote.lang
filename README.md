#Vote.lang

Vote for your favorite langauge/framework/etc. This isn't really to prove (or do) anything other than be an Express.io (Express.js + Sockets.io) experiment.

Lots o' languages are in here, plus their logos. This repo might be useful it you need the logos for various programming languages, and are too lazy to look for them.
